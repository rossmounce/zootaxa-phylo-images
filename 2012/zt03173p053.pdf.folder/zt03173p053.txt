Abstract
We describe Hydroporus bithynicus sp. n. (Coleoptera, Dytiscidae, Hydroporinae) from the Bolu province in north-western Turkey. The species belongs to the newly defined H. ferrugineus group, and can be separated from the other two members (H. ferrugineus Stephens, 1829 and H. sanfilippoi Ghidini, 1958) by its more flattened shape, less developed eyes
and shape of male genitalia. Its external morphology and the habitat in which all specimens were found (a small pool with
upwelling spring water next to a stream) suggest an interstitial habitat, similar to that reported for other species of the
group. We present a molecular phylogeny of the species of the H. memnonius and H. longulus groups, including some
representatives of the main lineages within the genus, based on ca. 2 kb of four mitochondrial genes. We redefine the H.
memnonius group and recognise the H. ferrugineus, H. obsoletus and H. morio groups of species as separate entities. Hydroporus neglectus Schaum, 1845 was found to be related to the species of the H. angustatus, but not the H. memnonius
group.

Introduction
The genus Hydroporus Clairville, 1806, with 181 described species including the one described here (35 of them
known from Turkey) (Nilsson 2001; Fery & Hendrich 2011), is one of the largest among diving beetles (Dytiscidae). The traditional subgenera are no longer considered valid (Nilsson 2001), and it is currently divided in “species groups” based on characters of external morphology. Recent molecular phylogenies of the genus have shown
that some of these groups largely correspond with monophyletic lineages (Ribera et al. 2003), although the incomplete sampling of this study did not allow to obtain general conclusions.
The finding of a new species of Hydroporus apparently related to H. ferrugineus Stephens, 1829 in north-western Turkey in 2006 prompted us to re-evaluate the composition and the phylogenetic relationships of the species of
the H. memnonius group, to which H. ferrugineus was assumed to belong (Fery 1999; Nilsson 2001), as well as that
of closer species groups, such as the H. longulus group (former Sternoporus Falkenström, 1930), found to be sister
to H. memnonius Nicolai, 1822 plus H. melanarius Sturm, 1835 in Ribera et al. (2003).

Material and methods
Taxon sampling. We use a wide representation of species of Hydroporus, including Suphrodytes dorsalis (Fabricius, 1787), shown to be nested within Hydroporus in Ribera et al. (2003) (Table 1). As outgroup we use three spe-

cies of Hydrocolus Roughley & Larson, 2000 confirmed to be sister to Hydroporus in Ribera et al. (2008), as
hypothesised by Larson et al. (2000).
Specimens were preserved in absolute ethanol in the field. Extractions of single specimens were non-destructive, using a standard phenol-chloroform method or the DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany).
Vouchers and DNA samples are kept in the collections of the MNCN and IBE (see abbreviations below).
We amplified fragments of four mitochondrial genes: 3’ end of cox1; 3’ end of rrnL; full trnL; 5’ end of nad1
(see Ribera et al. 2002 and 2010 for primers and general PCR conditions). Sequences were assembled and edited
using Sequencher TM 4.1.4 (Gene Codes, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI). New sequences have been deposited in GenBank
(EMBL) (see Table 1 for the Accession Numbers).

Phylogenetic analyses. We aligned the sequences using MAFFT online v.6 and the Q-INS-i algorithm (Katoh
& Toh 2008), a progressive pair-wise method with secondary refinement. Bayesian analyses were conducted on a
combined data matrix with MrBayes 3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist 2001), which runs two independent, simultaneous analyses, using four partitions corresponding to the four genes and with a GTR+I+ evolutionary model, the
most complex evolutionary model available. MrBayes ran using default values, saving trees at each 500th generation. Convergence and “burn-in” values were established after visual examination of a plot of the standard deviation of the split frequencies between two simultaneous runs.
We also conducted maximum likelihood searches in Garli v.0.951 (www.bio.utexas.edu/faculty/garli/
Garli.html), which uses genetic algorithms (Zwickl 2006), with an estimated GTR+I+ model for the combined
sequence and the default settings. Support was measured with 1,000 bootstrap replicates, reducing the number of
generations without improving the topology necessary to complete each replicate to 5,000.
Estimation of the ages of diversification. To calibrate the tree we use molecular clock-methods, with a combined rate for the mitochondrial genes of 2.3% per MY (i.e. the standard arthropod clock, Brower 1994), shown to
be accurate for a mixture of protein coding and ribosomal mitochondrial genes in Coleoptera (Papadopoulou et al.
2010; Ribera et al. 2010). To obtain an ultrametric tree we used Bayesian estimations as implemented in Beast
1.4.7 (Drummond & Rambaut 2007). Well supported nodes according to the results were constrained to be monophyletic, and a GTR+I+ model was enforced with an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock and a Yule process
speciation model. Priors and other parameters were left with default values, with the exception of the prior of the
evolutionary rate, which was set to a normal distribution with mean of 0.0115 substitutions/site/MY and a standard
deviation of 0.001. The results of two independent runs were merged with Tracer v1.4 and TreeAnnotator v1.4.7
(Drummond & Rambaut 2007).

(Fery 1999). Of the known species of the H. ferrugineus subgroup, H. bithynicus sp. n. is the flattest, narrowest and
more parallel sided. The eyes are also smaller than in the other two species, which is particularly evident in ventral
view. The aedeagus has also a characteristic shape, unlike H. ferrugineus and H. sanfilippoi Ghidini, 1958 (see
Fery 1999: figs 68, 70).
Description. Total length 3.7–4.0 mm, maximum width 1.7–1.8 mm. Body elongate, narrow, sides parallel;
lateral outline almost continuous; pronotum slightly wider than base of elytra, as wide as maximum width of elytra
(Fig. 1). Colour uniformly testaceous, ventral side darker.

Head (Figs 1, 2): wide; surface finely microreticulated, with polygonal, isodiametric cells; covered with very
fine, dense punctation; space between punctures 2–3 times wider than their diameter. Two small clypeal fossae;
periocular area slightly depressed. Eyes small, not prominent. Maximum diameter of eye (seen from above) ca. 11–
12 ommatidia (15–16 in H. sanfilippoi); surface of ommatidia transparent, pigmented area below cuticle smaller
than area covered by ommatidia (Fig. 2).
Pronotum (Figs 1, 2): transverse; sides strongly bordered, slightly arched. Surface microreticulate, stronger
and with larger cells than on head; punctation on disk sparser and stronger than on head; near posterior angles
punctation denser, with a more rugose appearance. Anterior margin with irregular row of coarse punctures. Anterior angles with a group of very long setae. Hind wings apparently well developed.
Elytra (Fig. 1): parallel sided, maximum width behind middle; surface covered with dense and strong punctation; microreticulation strong, cells wider than on pronotum and head, isodiametric. Without regular rows of punctures; with some isolated coarser punctures with setae less erect that those of regular punctures, forming loose
series on the elytra. Margins with a series of very long setae, from shoulder to apex.
Ventral darker than dorsal side; metaventrum and first two or three abdominal ventrites dark brown; surface of
metaventrite covered with regular, coarse and sparse punctation, space between punctures ca. 3 times wider than
their diameter; covered by strong reticulation, cells slightly transverse (Fig. 3). Abdominal ventrites with weaker
punctation, more disperse; surface microreticulated, with smaller cells than on metaventrite (Fig. 3). Posterior margin of metacoxal process slightly sinuate, medially protruded backwards (Fig. 3).
Male: pro- and mesotarsi slightly dilated; claws unmodified. Aedeagus as in Figs 4-6.
Etymology. Named after Bithynia, ancient kingdom of the NW coast of Anatolia and Roman province. The
specific epithet is an adjective in the nominative singular.
Distribution and habitat. So far only known from the type locality, a fast-flowing stream in a well preserved
mixed forest in north-west Turkey (Figs 7–9). All specimens were found in a small pool with upwelling spring
water (ca. 1 m diameter, few centimetres deep) on the side of the river. The pool had a stony substratum without
vegetation, with some algal and bacterial grow, and was fed by underground water upwelling through the bottom
(Figs 7, 9).
The habitat and the external morphology, in particular the reduced eye size and pigmentation and the presence
of long sensory setae on pronotum and elytra, suggest that the species is an inhabitant of the interstitial water, only
accessible in particular circumstances – in this case, an upwelling spring. The other two species of the group,
although with an apparently less modified morphology (they are less flat, with larger eyes) have been reported from
similar habitats, or, in the case of H. ferrugineus, from deep inside caves (Franciscolo 1979; Foster & Friday 2011).
The specimen of H. sanfilippoi sequenced here (Table 1) was collected in the small pools of a minuscule stream
formed by upwelling water while there was heavy rain: short after the specimen was collected the rain stopped and
the stream dried out completely. Only after some additional rain during the next days it was flowing again, and
more specimens could be found. The preference for very small running water bodies or interstitial habitats seems to
be shared between the species of the H. ferrugineus, memnonius and longulus groups (see below), and has been
suggested as a possible reason for the abundance of the local endemics in the group (Fery 2009; Hájek & Fiká ek
2010).

Phylogeny of the Hydroporus memnonius and related groups
The concatenated sequence had a final length of 1615 nucleotides, 826 corresponding to the cox1 gen (without any
indel) and 729 to the rrnL+trnL+nad1 fragment (with 4–5 indels as aligned with MAFFT). MrBayes run for 5·106
generations, after which the standard deviation of the split frequencies between the two simultaneous runs reached
values of ca. 0.01, indicating a good convergence. The two methods used for the phylogenetic reconstruction
(Bayesian probabilities and Maximum Likelihood with a heuristic genetic algorithm) resulted in very similar topologies, with only the position of some species differing between them (H. submuticus Thomson, 1874, H. tessellatus
(Drapiez, 1819), Fig. 10). The alternative topologies for these nodes did not change the composition of the species
groups, and their support was, in any case, always low, with all well supported nodes (Bayesian posterior probability, Bpp > 0.9, ML bootstrap, MLb > 70%) congruent between methods.
The monophyly of Hydroporus plus Suphrodytes was well supported (Bpp = 1, MLb = 100%; Fig. 10), but the

phylogenetic position of Suphrodytes not: it appears nested within Hydroporus with low support in the Bayesian
analysis, but unresolved at the base of Hydroporus with ML (Fig. 10). With our data we, thus, cannot exclude the
status of Suphrodytes and Hydroporus as separate genera (Angus 1985).

Within the wider Hydroporus+Suphrodytes clade the species groups defined by Nilsson & Holmen (1995) and
Nilsson (2001) are in general recovered as monophyletic, and with good support. This agreement between morphological and genetic discontinuities among the species, allowing the recognition of phenotypic species groups and
providing good support for the same clades based on genetic data, is most remarkable giving the independence of
both sets of characters. Thus, when plotting the average support of the nodes according to their topological level in
the tree in Fig. 10, the level at which the support is maximum (nodes at the fifth level, average support Bpp = 0.91,
Fig. 11) is also the one at which there is the highest number of nodes defining species groups (seven). One possible
cause of this agreement is that both set of characters are neutral and evolve at a rate proportional to time (Ahrens &
Ribera 2009).
In some cases our results do not agree with the established species groups. Hydroporus morio Aubé, 1838 was
included in the H. nigellus group in Nilsson & Holmen (1995), but listed under the H. puberulus group in Nilsson
(2001). We found it in a rather isolated position, although more related to the H. nigellus than to the H. puberulus
group (Fig. 10). We found H. neglectus Schaum, 1845 closer to H. angustatus Sturm, 1835 than to H. scalesianus
Stephens, 1828, suggesting the need to merge both species groups, but in any case not related to the species of the
H. memnonius or H. longulus groups, as traditionally suggested (see Fery 2009 for an overview). Similarly, H. pervicinus Fall, 1923, placed in the H. nigellus group in Nilsson (2001), was found to be more closely related to the
species of the H. longiusculus group (Fig. 10). Hydroporus subpubescens LeConte, 1852 appears nested within the
species of the H. nigellus group, suggesting that it should be included here rather than in a separate species group as
previously considered (Nilsson, 2001).
Hydroporus obsoletus Aubé, 1838 has been traditionally included in the H. memnonius group, close to the species of the H. ferrugineus subgroup (Fery 1999, 2009). We found it in an isolated position as sister to a large part of
the Palaearctic species, although with low support, which in any case warrants its consideration as a separate species group. Hydroporus obsoletus is widely distributed through Europe and north Africa, and despite the homogeneity of the male genitalia through his range (Fery 1999) there are deep genetic divergences among the specimens
from Algeria and Tunisia and those of the western Mediterranean (SW Morocco and Portugal) (Fig. 10, Table 1).
We found strong support for an extended Hydroporus planus group, including the H. marginatus, H. tessellatus
and H. nigrita groups, in agreement with Ribera et al. (2003) (their “H. fuscipennis sensu lato”). The internal phylogeny of this extended group was not well resolved, but it seems that the elytral reticulation (traditionally used to
separate these species groups) is a very labile character with very weak phylogenetic information. The extended H.
planus group is sister to a large clade including the species of the H. memnonius and H. longulus groups sensu Fery
(1999). Within this large clade the species phylogenetically close to H. ferrugineus, including H. bithynicus sp. n.,
are sister to the rest, thus rendering the H. memnonius group as traditionally defined paraphyletic. Hydroporus
bithynicus sp. n. is sister to the central and north European H. ferrugineus, and both sister to H. sanfilippoi from
Italy. These three species should be considered a group within the genus Hydroporus, the H. ferrugineus group.
Within the H. memnonius group (in its restricted sense defined here, i.e. excluding the species of the H. ferrugineus and H. obsoletus groups), the species with the angularity in the female gonocoxa form a well supported clade,
corresponding to the H. memnonius subgroup sensu Fery (1999). However, Hydroporus longicornis Sharp, 1871
was found to be sister to the rest of the species of the group, and not included in the H. melanarius complex, as suggested by Fery (1999).
The Hydroporus longulus group (the former subgenus Sternoporus, see Fery 2009 for a review) was found
monophyletic with strong support, but highly derived within the genus Hydroporus, so that its reinstatement as
valid subgenus would render Hydroporus s. str. highly paraphyletic. Among the sampled species of the H. longulus
group we found three linages: the eastern Mediterranean H. bodemeyeri bodemeyeri Ganglbauer, 1900 plus H.
cuprescens K.W. Miller & Fery, 1995 from Cyprus (as hypothesised in Hájek & Fiká ek 2010); the H. kraatzii
complex, including H. sardomontanus Pederzani, Rocchi & Schizzerotto, 2004 from Sardinia; and the H. longulus
complex plus the Corsican H. regularis Sharp, 1882. It is interesting to note that each of these lineages has an
inland endemic, and that the species from Corsica and Sardinia (H. regularis and H. sardomontanus) are not sister
species.
Within the H. longulus complex, and despite the clear morphological differences, the mitochondrial markers
used here do not recover the species as monophyletic, probably as a result of their recent divergence (see below).
The same happens with the H. melanarius complex.

Estimation of divergence times
We restricted our analyses of divergence times to the clade of the H. memnonius, H. longulus and H. ferrugineus
groups, for which the sampling was most complete. Using an evolutionary rate of 0.0115 substitutions/site/MY, the
origin of the whole clade was estimated to be at late Miocene (Fig. 12), and that of the three species groups at Pliocene. As usual when using a single constraint for the estimation (in this case, the average evolutionary rate), the
intervals of 95% confidence for the estimated ages are very large, so they have to be taken with caution. Even considering that our sampling is incomplete, with some species missing from the tree, all the speciation events were
estimated to have occurred during the Pleistocene with the only possible exception of H. longicornis, which origin
was estimated to be at early Pliocene (Fig. 12). The separation between H. ferrugineus and H. bithynicus sp. n. was
estimated to be at middle Pleistocene.
