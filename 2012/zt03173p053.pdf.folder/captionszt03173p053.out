FIGURE 10. Phylogram obtained with MrBayes. Above nodes, Bayesian posterior probabilities (when > 0.5) / bootstrap support values in Garli (when > 50%). “-”, node not resolved; “x”, node not present. See Table 1 for the localities and voucher reference of the specimens.

FIGURE 12. Ultrametric tree obtained with Beast and an evolutionary rate of 0.0115 substitutions/site/MY for the H. memnonius, H. longulus and H. ferrugineus groups. Numbers in nodes, estimated ages; blue bars, 95% confidence intervals.
