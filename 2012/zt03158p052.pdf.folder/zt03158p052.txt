Abstract
A new species of Oreobates is described from Cavernas do Peruaçu National Park, Januária, Minas Gerais state, in the
Atlantic Dry Forests of Brazil. The new species is distinguished from all other Oreobates by having the following combination of characters: large tympanum, discs broadly enlarged and truncate on Fingers III and IV, smooth dorsal skin, nuptial pads absent, snout subacuminate, and a very short pulsatile (2–3 pulses) single-noted advertisement call with dominant
frequency of about 3150 Hz, and no harmonic structure. Molecular phylogenetic analyses using partial sequences of the
mitochondrial genes cytochrome b (cyt b) and 16S using multiple outgroups recovered the new species within Oreobates
and sister to O. heterodactylus. The latter species inhabits the Dry Forests of Mato Grosso (Cerrado) and Bolivia (Chiquitano forests), and is strictly associated to these habitats, which suggests a preterit connection between Chiquitano and
Atlantic Dry Forests. The discovery of a new Oreobates in the Atlantic Dry Forest is of great importance for the conservation of these dry forests, as it is known only from this type of habitat.
Key words: Peruaçu valley, Pandeiros River, Terrarana

Introduction
The distribution patterns of species with physiological restrictiveness to certain kinds of habitats are always of
great importance to understanding the biogeographic history of those habitats because of the common history they
share (Croizat 1964). Habitat range and connectivity are affected by environmental changes, such as those promoted by climatic fluctuations, resulting generally in species dispersal or isolation, leading ultimately to speciation
(Lomolino et al. 2006). Therefore phylogenetic relationships among species occurring in different and/or same
habitats can inform us about the history of habitats (Crisci et al. 2003; Morrone 2009).
Frogs of genus Oreobates seem to be habitat-specialists. Most of its 16 species are restricted to Yungas montane forests from the eastern versant of the Cordillera Oriental of the Andes, from northern Argentina to Ecuador.
However one species, O. quixensis, is an eminently Amazonian lowland dweller that occurs throughout the Upper
Amazon Basin, from Colombia to Bolivia. All but one species of Oreobates occur in the Andes or close to them in
the adjacent Amazonian lowlands. The exception is O. heterodactylus, an inhabitant of Cerrado and Chiquitano
forests in eastern Bolvia and western Brazil (see Padial & De la Riva 2005; Padial et al. 2008a; Duellman & Lehr
2009).
The taxonomy of Oreobates has been in constant change since its description, and only recently has a molecular phylogenetic approach been used to infer relationships among its species closely related genera (Hedges et al.
2008; Padial et al. 2008a; Padial et al. 2009; Pyron & Wiens 2011). The genus Oreobates, and its type species, Oreobayes quixensis, were originally described by Jiménez de la Espada (1872) and placed in the family Cystignathidae. A few years later, Boulenger (1882) recognized Oreobates as a junior synonym of Borborocoetes Cope, 1865.
At the end of the 19th Century, Cystignathus was recognized as a junior synonym of Leptodactylus, and O. quixen-

sis was then placed in Leptodactylidae (Werner 1896). Peters (1955) placed it into the synonymy of Eusophus Fitzinger, 1843, where it remained until Lynch and Schwartz (1971) relocated O. quixensis to Ischnocnema Reinhardt
and Lütken, 1862, rendering Oreobates a junior synonym of Ischnocnema. About 35 years latter Caramaschi and
Canedo (2006), in their morphological taxonomic reassessment of the genera Ischnocnema and Oreobates, resurrected Oreobates and relocated I. saxatilis, I. sanctaecrucis, I. sanderi, I. simmonsi and I. choristolemma (by implication) to Oreobates. One year later, a molecular phylogenetic study on the once eleutherodactyline frogs, found
large, deeply rooted radiations of geographically isolated groups within New World direct-developing frogs (Heinicke et al. 2007), which led to a preliminary reorganization of the taxonomy of eleutherodactyline frogs. However,
Oreobates was not affected by any taxonomic change. On the following year, a morphological and molecular study
on Oreobates revealed that Eleutherodactylus cruralis, E. discoidalis, E. granulosus, E. heterodactylus, E. ibischi,
E. lehri, E. madidi, and E. zongonensis, clustered together in a clade also containing O. quixensis, I. choristolemma
I. sanctaecrucis, I. sanderi, I. saxatilis, and I. simmonsi (Padial et al. 2008a). The genus Oreobates was therefore
redefined accordingly to include the aforementioned species. That same year a large molecular phylogenetic
assessment on eleutherodactyline frogs proposed the name Terrarana for a Neotropical group harboring terrestrial
breeding frogs with direct development (equivalent to Frost’s et al. [2006] Brachycephalidae) (Hedges et al. 2008).
Hedges et al. (2008) supported Padial et al. (2008a) hypothesis and kept Oreobates as it was but added E. pereger.
Finally, that same year a new species, O. barituensis, was described from Baritú, Santa Victoria Department, Salta
province, Argentina (Vaira & Ferrari 2008), and Oreobates achieved the taxonomic content recognized today.
Following Padial et al. (2008a) phylogenetic hypothesis for Oreobates intrageneric relationships, O. heterodactylus originated from Andean ancestor that dispersed throughout the adjacent lowlands, reaching the current
Bolivian-Brazilian border (Miranda Ribeiro 1937; Padial & De la Riva 2005), an area now covered by Seasonally
Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF) or Chiquitano forests.
These SDTFs ecorregion lies within the Tropical Dry Forest biome (sensu Olson et al. 2001), within which the
Brazilian Atlantic Dry Forest (ADF) ecoregion also occurs, forming a N-S oriented stripe between Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga. Those dry forests are composed of deciduous and semideciduous arborescent vegetation, that
are lower, more open, and poorer in woody species when compared to Rain Forests (Murphy & Lugo 1986;
Oliveira-Filho & Ratter 2002). They are found on rich soil, where annual rainfall is less than 1600 mm, and there
are at least 5–6 dry months per year (i.e. months with rainfall less than 100 mm) (Pennington et al. 2000).
SDTFs are among the most endangered tropical environments (Janzen 1988). About 97% of its coverage is in
danger and more than a half of these kind of environments are located in South America (Miles et al. 2006). In the
Neotropics the Rain Forest are the environments that have historically been main targets of biological studies and
conservations efforts, leaving less studied environments, such as the dryer ones, with their biotic content virtually
unknown and unprotected (Janzen 1988; Redford et al. 1990; Sánchez-Azofeifa et al. 2005). Within the Brazilian
territory only a large patch of SDTFs at Goias state has been herpetologically surveyed, however it was focused
only in lizards (Werneck & Colli 2006).
In Brazil one of the few protected remnant areas covered predominantly with SDTFs is the Peruaçu river valley
region (Silva 2001), which harbors a National and a State Park. Although this region is considered a priority for
conservation (MMA 2000; Tabarelli & Silva 2003), and is especially important for conservation of the herpetofauna (MMA 2000), the only reptiles and amphibians records from this area are those resulting from surveys for the
National Park management plan (Feio 2003).
Feio (2003) in his herpetological survey at Cavernas do Peruaçu National Park recorded a species which he
attributed at that time to Eleutherodactylus, and which he considered as “certainly new species”. However under
the current Terrarana taxonomy, and in the light of molecular data we recognize this as a Oreobates species. Herein,
on the basis of a series of specimens obtained during an extensive herpetofaunal survey at this area, we describe
this new species, its advertisement call, and some aspects of its natural history. On the basis of a molecular analysis
of mitochondrial genes we also investigate its phylogenetic placement within Oreobates and discuss the biogeography of the genus and its implication to SDTFs biogeography.

descriptions follow Padial et al. (2008a). Measurements were taken with an electronic caliper after fixation to the
nearest 0.1 mm. Observations of morphological characters were performed with a stereomicroscope Zeiss STEMI
SV6. Measurements taken were: snout-vent length (SVL); tibia length, from knee to heel (TL); thighs length, measured from mid-cloaca to knee (THL); foot length, measured from proximal end of inner metatarsal tubercle to tip
of fourth toe (FL); head length, from tip of snout to posterior end of jaw (HL); head width, the distance between
posterior ends of jaw (HW); internarinal distance (IND); eye-eye distance, the distance between anterior corner of
eyes (EE); eye-nostril distance, from anterior corner of eye to nostril (EN); eye diameter, horizontal distance
between anterior and posterior corners of eyes (ED); tympanum diameter, measured from the edges of tympanic
annulus (TD).
Comparisons with other species were based on the original and/or secondary descriptions of those species
(Lynch 1975; Padial & De la Riva 2005; Padial et al. 2008a; Padial et al. 2008b; Duellman & Lehr 2009), holotype
pictures from original publications, and comparison of the following voucher specimens housed in Museu de Zoologia da Universidade de São Paulo: Oreobates discoidalis, Horco Molle, Tucumán province, Argentina (MZUSP
85542); Oreobates cruralis, Sara, Santa Cruz province, Bolivia (MZUSP 119467); Oreobates heterodactylus,
Fazenda Santa Edwiges, Mato Grosso state, Brazil (MZUSP 71103, 71104).
Records on maps were compiled from the literature (Jiménez de la Espada 1872; Lynch 1975; Duellman 1990;
Heyer & Gascon 1995; Alonso & Dallmeier 1998; Doan & Arriaga 2002; Cisneros-Heredia 2003; Pérez et al.
2004; Harvey & Sheehy 2005; Padial & De la Riva 2005; Vaira & Ferrari 2008; Ferrari & Vaira 2008; Padial et al.
2008a; Padial et al. 2008b; Akmentins & Vaira 2009; Duellman & Lehr 2009; UHESA 2011), online databases
(GBIF 2011), and vouchers from Museu de Zoologia da Universidade de São Paulo (MZUSP). Redundant records
were removed.
Bioacoustics. Calls were recorded with sampling rate of 44.1 kHz and 16 bit of resolution, with a Panasonic
portable digital audio recorder model RR-US450, using its built-in microphone with recording frequency up to 7
kHz in a mono channel. Audio analysis and generation of audiospectrogram and oscillograms were performed with
Sound Ruler v. 0.9.6 software (Gridi-Papp 2007). Air temperatures were taken with quick-reading Miller and
Weber Inc. thermometer, model T-6000.
Field sampling methods. Specimen collection was made primarily through pitfall traps with drift fences
installed throughout the main habits at Cavernas do Peruaçu National Park: 15 on dry forest habitats; 15 on
savanna; 17 on the “carrascos” and two on riparian evergreen forest, which remained opened along across January
2008 and 2009 (rainy seasons), and July 2008 and 2009 (dry seasons). Unquantified active search was also performed at areas unsuitable to pitfall installation. Collected individuals were sacrificed with lethal doses of anesthetics, fixed in 10% formalin, preserved in 70% ethanol, and housed at Museu de Zoologia da Universidade de São
Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.
Phylogenetic analysis. Partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) and 16S genes of the holotype and two paratypes of the new species were obtained. Protocols for DNA extraction, amplification, sequencing,
and sequence editing followed Amaro et al. (2009). The mitochondrial genic fragments were amplified with primers CB1-L and CB3-H for cyt b and 16SAR and 16SBR for 16S (Palumbi 1996). (GenBank accession numbers:
JN688273-JN688278).
Sequences were edited in CodonCode Aligner (CodonCode Corporation) and aligned with MEGA 5 (Tamura
et al. 2011). The matrix of 328 bp of aligned sequences of cyt b showed no indels. The alignment of 16S was made
based on secondary structure and resulted in a matrix of 529 bp. Both data set were combined in a matrix of 857 bp
and 20 terminals, including own sequences and sequences from Padial et al. (2008a) that includes species of Strabomantinae genera (Oreobates, Pristimantis, Strabomantis, Hypodactylus and Phrynopus); Leptodactylus species
were used as outgroup. We performed a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis in MrBayes 3.0b4 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003): two independent Bayesian analyses were performed with a random starting tree, four incrementally
heated Markov chains, and 10,000,000 generations, with trees sampled every 100 generations to estimate likelihood and sequence evolution parameters. The best–fit model of nucleotide substitution selected using the Akaike
information criterion (AIC) in MrModeltest v.2.2 (Nylander 2004) was HKY+I+G for both partitions. Stationarity
for each run was detected by plotting the likelihood scores of the trees against generation time, and the topology,
posterior probability values, and branch lengths inferences were estimated after discarding 25% of the initial trees
of each run as burn-in samples. Nodes with posterior probability 0.9 on a 50% majority rule consensus tree from

both runs were considered significant support for a given clade. The majority 50% consensus tree saved with posterior probabilities on the nodes was visualized using FigTree 1.3.1 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/). Uncorrected genetic
distances (p distances) were also calculated using PAUP.

Measurements of the holotype (mm). SVL = 32.18; HL = 11.76; HW = 10.93; EN = 4.14; EE = 5.8; ED =
4.5; TD = 2.54; THL = 16.5; TL = 17.03; FL = 15.94; IND = 2.44.
Variation. We found little variation on morphological characters among the specimens, varying mainly in
body size. Measurements are presented on Table 1. The only adult female has a larger SVL than adult males. The
dorsum shows some variation in coloration and patterns, varying from yellowish brown background color with
scattered dark marks to reddish brown with dorsolateral dark marks aligned marks, forming an irregular longitudinal stripe (Fig. 3). Some individuals also show a slightly visible middorsal fold.
Advertisement call. Calls were recorded on 9th January 2009 at 21:16h; air temperature was 21ºC. Sixteen
calls from four specimens were analyzed. The advertisement call consist on a series of single short pulsed notes
averaging 104 ms in length (range = 89–142 ms) having 2–3 pulses each, however the poor quality of the record-

ings do not allow an accurate count of pulses. The calls show no harmonic structure, has no amplitude modulation
and pulses are amplitude modulated. The average call repetition rate is 31.6 call/min (18–45 call/min). The average
dominant frequency is 3150.7 Hz (2866.5–3395.7 Hz) (Fig. 4).

Comparison with other species (data for species other than Oreobates remotus in parenthesis). Oreobates
remotus can be distinguished from O. barituensis, O. choristolemma, O. cruralis, O. granulosus, O. lehri, O.
madidi, O. pereger, O. quixensis, O. sanctacrucis, O. sanderi, O. saxatilis, O. simmonsi, and O. zongonensis by
having dorsal skin smooth and broadly enlarged truncate discs on Fingers III and IV (dorsal skin shagreened to
granular and discs on Finger III and IV not enlarged). From O. ibischi by having dorsal skin smooth, broadly
enlarged truncated discs on Fingers III and IV, nuptial pads absent and advertisement call notes having 2–3 pulses
each (dorsal skin granular, discs on Finger III and IV only slightly enlarged, nuptial pads present and advertisement
call notes having 6–8). From O. discoidalis by the absence of toe webbing, larger discs on Fingers III and IV, and
advertisement call consisting of a single short pulsed note with 104 ms in length, dominant frequency of about

3150 Hz and 2–3 pulses per note (toes basally webbing, proportionally smaller discs on Fingers III and IV, and call
composed of a single longer pulsed note with 582 ms in length, dominant frequency of about 2200 hz and 8–11
pulses per note). Oreobates remotus is more similar to O. heterodactylus, from which it can be distinguished by
absence of nuptial pads, subacuminated snout in dorsal view, and shorter advertisement call with dominant frequency of about 3150 Hz, no harmonic structure and 2–3 pulses per note (nuptial pads present, slightly truncated
snout in dorsal view and call is a single pulsed note with dominant frequency of about 3950 hz, having 3 to 5 harmonics and 5–9 pulses per note). Additionally O. remotus has, proportionally to body size, a larger hand than any
other species of Oreobates.

Natural history and distribution. All individuals of Oreobates remotus sp. nov. were found only during the
rainy seasons. During our first expedition to Peruaçu valley, only one juvenile was found at a semideciduous forest.
However that rainy season was atypical as the precipitation was very low (about 500 mm3). The second sampled
rainy season was a typical one (about 1000 mm3) and individuals became very abundant. Many juveniles were
found in pitfall traps and along the dry forest floor jumping over the leaf-litter. No individual was found in non-forest environments (e.g. savanna and carrasco). All adults were found in wet limestone outcrops covered with
mosses on the roadside within the dry forest (Fig. 5). Males where heard calling at night from the wet walls and
crevices of the outcrops, especially during rainy days.
The new species is currently known only from the vicinities of the type locality, Peruaçu river valley, and from
Pandeiros River, both at northern Minas Gerais state, Brazil (Figs. 6 and 7). Although geographical information for
this latter record is imprecise, Pandeiros River is also located at the left margin of São Francisco River, about 70
km SW from Peruaçu region. Both areas lie at the southernmost end of the Atlantic Dry Forest.
Phylogenetic relationships. Both individual and combined analyses of mitochondrial genes cytochrome b (cyt
b) and 16S recovered Oreobates remotus sp. nov. deeply embedded within Oreobates and sister to O. heterodactylus (Fig. 8), with 10% of interspecific divergence for 16S and 16–17% for cyt b between them. The clade comprising O. cruralis, O. discoidalis and O. madidi is recovered as sister to that containing O. remotus sp. nov. and O.
heterodactylus, while O. quixensis and O. sanderi are recovered in a basal position. The remaining relationships
within Strabomantinae were poorly supported, similar to results of Padial et al. (2008b, 2009).

Discussion
Although our molecular phylogenetic hypothesis do not includes all Oreobates species, they recovered O. heterodactylus as a sister taxon of O. remotus sp. nov. with support. The placement of this species in Oreobates and its
affinities to O. heterodactylus are also supported by morphological, ecological and distributional evidence. Both

species are morphologically similar, occur in the same microhabitats, and are biogeographically associated to dry
forests. The broadly enlarged and truncated discs in Finger III and IV are the most conspicuous traits shared by
both species.

FIGURE 5. Habitats: General view of the dry forest during rainy season (A), and during the dry season (B); Limestone outcrops (“Rochedo”) within the dry forest where adult males of Oreobates remotus sp. nov. were found calling, and where the
holotype was collected (C).

Padial et al. (2008a) provided a phylogenetic hypothesis for intrageneric relationships in Oreobates in which
the most parsimonious biogeographical scenario was an origin of Oreobates from an ancestor at the upper Amazon
basin and Andes foothills. Their hypothesis also implied a subsequent colonization of higher altitudes, in the
Andean Cordillera Oriental, and two subsequent radiations, one of robust species and one of smaller species mainly
occurring in from Central Bolivia to Argentina across the Andean hills. They also suggested that O. heterodactylus,
a member of the clade with small species, would have originated from an ancestor that dispersed through the lowlands and reached the Brazilian Precambrian Shield. However their phylogenetic hypothesis used to construct this
biogeographical scenario missed Oreobates closest related genera, Lynchius and Phrynopus (Hedges et al. 2008,
Padial et al. 2009, Pyron & Wiens 2011).
However, given the recently published phylogenetic hypotheses (Hedges et al. 2008; Padial et al. 2009; Pyron
& Wiens 2011) new and more complete view of Oreobates biogeography can be drawn. Species within the genus
Phrynopus occurs at the humid montane forests and supra-tree line grasslands between 2200–4400 m a.s.l. and
Lynchius in similar habitats between 2200–3100 m a.s.l., both at Andean Cordillera Oriental (Hedges et al. 2008).

Therefore the association with Andean habitats seems to be a simplesiomorphic feature for Oreobates, Lynchius
and Phrynopus, indicating that their common ancestor was of Andean origin. Therefore, the present association of
Oreobates to Andean habitats should be considered plesiomorphic, and the occupancy of the lowlands apomorphic.
The colonization of the lowland by O. quixensis may well be considered an early event. Subsequently, a second,
independent colonization of the lowlands, when lowland Chiquitano and Atlantic Dry Forests were colonized,
would have taken place from the ancestor of clade of small Oreobates (O. barituensis, O. cruralis, O. discoidalis,
O. heterodactylus, O. madidi, and O. heterodactylus). Probably the only lowland diversification event within Oreobates was the origin of O. heterodactylus and O. remotus from a common ancestor.

FIGURE 7. Map of the current known distribution of Oreobates remotus sp.nov.

Currently, Atlantic and Chiquitano Dry Forests are separated from each other by a distance of more than 1,000
km. However, the occurrence of tree species in both areas indicates an ancient connection between those two forests as suggested by the Pleistocene Arc hypothesis (Prado & Gibbs 1993; Pennington et al. 2000; Prado 2000).
This hypothesis states that during the Last Glacial Maximum, when a cold and dry climate took place over South
America, humid habitats, such as those of the Amazon and Atlantic Rain Forests, retracted and fragmented. Plant
species adapted to cold/dry climatic conditions spread then over central South America producing a large and continuous cover of dry forests that connected thus the Atlantic Dry Forest and the Chiquitano Forests (Prado & Gibbs
1993; Pennington et al. 2000; Prado 2000). Although the current distributional records of plant species associated
with dry forests indicates a preterit connection between these forests (Prado & Gibbs 1993; Pennington et al. 2000;
Prado 2000), recent molecular data on endemic plant species of the SDTFs showed no evidence of vicariance and
that their diversification was older than the Pleistocene as originally suggested (Pennington et al. 2004). Palynological data of plant species from Chiquitano Dry Forest is absent from Pleistocene pollen records (Mayle 2006), and
paleodistribution modeling also indicates an older event of dry forest expansion, as the LGM was too cold and dry

to allow it (Werneck et al. 2010). Moreover, the large genetic divergences between O. heterodactylus and O. remotus also suggest that the splitting was older than the Pleistocene. Faunistic evidence is nonetheless weak to support
this Pleistocene Arc hypothesis, and is currently based on shared species between SDTFs of Paranã valley at Goiás
state with the Caatingas (Moojen et al. 1997; Werneck & Colli 2006), suggesting a larger extension of dry habitats
in northeastern Brazil and their connection to eastern Cerrado SDTFs, and not a continuous dry habitat across Central Brazil.

FIGURE 8. Bayesian consensus tree topology obtained from the combined molecular data set (cyt b and 16S) showing the
placement of Oreobates remotus sp. nov. within Oreobates, and as sister taxon of O. heterodactylus. Numbers above nodes are
posterior probabilities.

The new species was recorded only at the southernmost end of the ADF, which was the only area properly sampled along this ecoregion. Oreobates remotus may have a wider distribution, which can be only confirmed by additional sampling along the remaining fragments of SDTFs northern from Peruaçu region. The present status of the
original vegetation cover of ADF was never properly addressed, but it seems to be highly fragmented with only
few areas protected in conservation unities (Silva 2001; Silva & Casteleti 2005). Although an apparently stable
population of Oreobates remotus occurs within a national park, undetected populations may be undergoing severe
anthropic pressure, as this forests are the main target areas for agriculture along central Brazil (Oliveira-Filho &
Ratter 2002). Conservation efforts along the remaining fragments of SDTFs are urgently necessary in order to
ensure the detection, investigation and continuity of the evolutionary processes of this biotic domain, which is only
beginning to be known.
