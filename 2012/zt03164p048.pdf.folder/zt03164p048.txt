Abstract
A new species of stonefly of the genus Siphonoperla from the Dinaric Mountains of Macedonia is described. The description of S. korab sp. n. is based on morphological and genetic characters. We also provide notes on habitat and distribution
of this new taxon. Further notes on the biogeography of the genus are added.
Key words: Plecoptera, Siphonoperla, new species, penial structures, mtDNA, Macedonia

Introduction
Species of the genus Siphonoperla Zwick, 1967 are relatively small chloroperline stoneflies usually associated with
cold spring habitats, but some species have been reported from lowlands. The systematics of the genus is much disputed (Weiss et al. 2011), and species are distinguished on morphological criteria. The genus Siphonoperla is distributed throughout Europe and occurs both in North Africa and in Central Asia. The genus currently includes
thirteen described species (DeWalt et al. 2011): S. hajastanica (Zhiltzova), S. libanica Alouf, S. lepineyi (Navás),
S. baetica (Aubert), S. burmeisteri (Pictet), S. montana (Pictet), S. neglecta (Rostock), S. graeca (Aubert), S. taurica (Pictet), S. ottomoogi Graf, S. torrentium (Pictet), S. transsylvanica (Kis) and S. italica (Aubert). In this study,
we focus on a morphologically similar species group comprising S. neglecta, S. graeca and the new species S.
korab sp. n.

Material and methods
Two specimens were collected using an aerial insect net and all material was stored originally in 70% ethanol but
transferred to 95% ethanol for genetic analysis. The holotype and paratype are deposited in the collection of the
Biologiezentrum Linz (LI-PLEC-2011/01), Austria. General distributions were compiled from data extracted from
the following publications: Aubert (1953, 1956), Alouf (1992), Braasch & Joost (1976), Despax (1951),
Fiałkowski & Kittel (2002), Fochetti (1995), Graf et al. (2008), Kimmins (1935), Kis (1963, 1974), Lillehammer
(1988), Loskutova (2003), Murányi (2007), Sivec (1980), Soldán et al. (1998), Weiss et al. (2011), and Zwick
(1971, 1981).
DNA extraction and Data analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from three Siphonoperla species (S.
neglecta, S. graeca and S. korab sp. n.) using DNeasy blood and tissue kits (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). A
PCR reaction was carried out to amplify a 650 bp region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (cox1) gene

using primers LCO-1490 and HCO-2198 (Folmer et al. 1994) in a 25 l reaction. PCR products were purified using
the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced in both directions using the
PCR primers. Samples were analyzed on a 3500xL (Applied Biosystems) automated sequencer.
Forwards and reverse reads were assembled and edited using CodonCode Aligner v 3.5 (Codon Code Corporation, Dedham, USA) and contigs were compared to the NCBI nucleotide database using blastn queries (http://
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on three Siphonoperla species. We also included two
other published Siphonoperla sp. cox1 sequences (i.e. of S. montana and S. ottomoogi, GenBank Accession Nos.
EU441195 and EU441202; Graf et al. 2008) as these showed >90% identity to our sequences in the blastn query
and additionally Perla sp. as an outgroup (obtained from /ibol.org/). All sequences were aligned using ClustalW
(Thompson et al. 1994) and a phylogenetic search was conducted using a maximum likelihood approach in PhyML
v 3.0 (Guindon & Gascuel 2003) under a GTR model of evolution (as determined by Modeltest v 3.7, Posada &
Crandall 1998) and bootstrapping of 1000 replications. Uncorrected pairwise p–distances among individuals were
generated with Mega 4.0 (Tamura et al. 2007). All newly generated DNA sequences have been deposited in GenBank (Accessions JN084076-JN084078).

(Figs. 3a–b, 4c, 5)
Diagnosis. This species is defined in the male by the presence of a broad U-shaped, penial spine area, and in both
sexes by a small rectangular and one spindle shaped sclerotisation of the pro- and mesosternite, respectively.
Description. General appearance genotypic, small, slender and yellowish; body length: male: 6.2 mm, with
wings 8.0 mm; female: 8.0 mm, with wings 10.0 mm.
Head: pale, no dark markings between ocelli; maxillary and labial palps brownish; antennae pale proximally,
from the 6th segment continuously brownish until the tip.
Pronotum: Completely pale with the exception of narrow brown marks medially, and on anterior and posterior
margins. Additionally one delicate brownish median line is present.
Thorax: Meso- and metaterga with brownish W-shaped markings. Legs pale, tarsi and tarsal claw brownish.
Pro- and mesosternite with a small rectangular and one spindle shaped sclerotisation (Fig. 4c).
Abdomen: Terga 2–7 with rectangular to triangular brownish patches. Tergum 1 with a broad brown stripe at
the anterior margin covering nearly the entire segment. Sternites and cerci pale.
Male genitalia. Male epiproct slender (Fig. 5), inner margin smoothly convex not curved.
Basal area of everted penial sac lacking spinules. Penial spine area broad, U-shaped and prominent (length =
421.3 µm, width = 320.8 µm) (Fig. 3a). Marginal spines distinctly broader and longer than others. Two small additional spine areas ventrolaterally (in respect to the everted penis) of the base of the titillators. Titillators long
(length = 1430.6 µm, Fig. 3b).
Female genitalia. Subgenital plate broad, covering half of the 8th segment. Slightly biconvex.
Eggs and larva. Unknown.
Material examined. Holotype male: Macedonia, Korab Mts., tributary of Žaba river, 41° 47’ 45.3’’N, 20° 36’
18.3’’E, 1830m asl., 3.7.2010, leg. A. Previši ; Paratype: 1 female, same data.
Remarks. In the genus Siphonoperla, arrangements of spines of the penial armature are diagnostic (Weiss et
al. 2011). Among those species with one median group of spines are S. taurica, S. burmeisteri, S. graeca, S.
neglecta and S. korab. These species have additionally ventrolateral narrow fields of spines (Zwick 1971, Fig. 11f;
Figs. 1c, 2b, 3b). Males of S. neglecta, S. graeca and S. burmeisteri are characterized by one median sclerotized
isosceles triangle shaped armature (Fig. 2a), whereas S. taurica has one narrow sclerotised patch of spines (Kis
1974, Fig. 155e). In S. burmeisteri there is a prominent median stiffening of the apical portion of the penis sac
(Zwick 1991, Kis 1974, fig. 154c). Siphonoperla graeca (Figs. 1a, c) has well sclerotized areas laterally at the base
of the titillators. Within this morphologically similar group including S. graeca, S. burmeisteri, and S. taurica, the
titillators are relatively short as compared to other members of the genus. Siphonoperla korab is apparently most
similar to both S. neglecta and S. graeca but differs by the broad, larger U-shaped penial spine-field (Fig. 3a). In S.
neglecta, the proportion between length and maximum width of the main spine-field is 1.496, in S. graeca it is
1.94, whereas in S. korab it is 1.31. Additionally, the relative dimensions of the spine field are diagnostic (maxi-

mum width: 239 µm; maximum length: 159 µm in S. neglecta; 209 µm and 107 µm in S. graeca and 421 µm and
320 µm respectively in S. korab). Titillator length of S. korab (1430.7 µm, Fig. 3b) is also similar to S. neglecta
(1214.6 µm, Fig. 2b).

FIGURE 3. Siphonoperla korab sp. n.: penial armatures a), dorsal view; b) right lateral view.

Siphonoperla graeca resembles S. burmeisteri in its penial spine area (Murányi 2007, fig. 86), and has very
short titillators (Figs. 1a, c). The length from the base to the tip is 588 µm, and overlaps the penis by 272.8 µm only.
In S. korab, the excess length is 991.9 µm, and in S. neglecta 775.2 µm, respectively.
In contrast to S. neglecta and S. korab the median spine area of S. burmeisteri (Kis 1974, fig. 154c) and S.
graeca bears spines in size and degree of sclerotisation similar to those at the margins (Fig. 1b), whereas both S.
neglecta and S. korab have much larger and darker marginal spines (Figs. 2a, 3a). Both S. neglecta and S. graeca
have prominent dark sclerotisations on thoracic sternites (Figs. 4a, b), but S. korab exhibits notable modifications
(Fig. 4c). In dorsal view, the epiproct of S. korab (Fig. 5) is similar to that of S. neglecta and not that broad at the
base as in S. graeca and S. burmeisteri. Its inner margin lacks a sharp curve as in S. montana.
Intraspecific variation of penial armatures seems to be low in the genus and apparent hybrids are unknown.
Although we analysed only one male and one female of S. korab the genetic and morphological differences to other
compared species are distinct.
Genetics. PCR amplification and sequencing of coxI was successful for the three Siphonoperla species. Overall species sequences were clearly similar to previously published data (Graf et al. 2008) based on a blastn search.
Combining our sequences with blastn query results produced an aligned matrix of 5 taxa and 442 characters. In the
maximum likelihood coxI gene tree (ln L = -1685.47326; Fig. 7) S. korab sp. n. sequence was phylogenetically
more similar to other Siphonoperla species of the neglecta-group (S. graeca, S. neglecta) with divergence ranging
from 3.8–5.0%, and genetically more distant to S. ottomoogi and S. montana, with 10.2% and 9.7% of divergence
between sequences.
Zoogeographical notes. The genus Siphonoperla exhibits as most Plecoptera, a general increase in
diversification from northern to southern latitudes of Europe. Only a few species (S. torrentium and S. burmeisteri)
are distributed in Northern Europe, with S. burmeisteri extending far to the east (St. Petersburg and the Pechora
Basin), and southwards to the Czech Republic (Bojková 2009) and Bulgaria (one disputable single record only) but
did not disperse into Western Europe. In contrast the Mediterranean peninsulas are inhabited by several species
such as S. baetica (Spain), S. graeca (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, Macedonia, Greece, Albania), S. libanica
(Anatolia, Lebanon), S. transsylvanica (Romania, Bulgaria), and S. italica (Italy). The generally eastern-distributed
S. neglecta is widespread (from the Balkans westwards to the margins of the Austrian Alps to the mountainous
ranges of Slovakia, the Czech Republic, but also western Germany). A similar distribution is apparent for S.
taurica with an eastward extension into the Crimean Peninsula. Siphonoperla montana has a more restricted
distribution occurring in the Beskids Mountains, the Šumava Mountains in the Czech Republic, the Alps, and the
Apennine and the Dinaric Mountains. A smaller area is inhabited by the microendemic S. ottomoogi (few records
in the Eastern Alps, Austria) and the subspecies S. torrentium manevali (Massiv Central, France). S. hajastanica
(Armenia), S. libanica (Anatolia, Lebanon) and S. lepineyi (Northern Africa) do not occur in Europe. Although the
status of several taxa (especially of the S. torrentium group) is much-disputed (Weiss et al. 2011), the high degree

of diversification and speciation at the Southern Peninsulas like the Balkans remains obvious. S. korab is a cold
spring-species of higher elevations (Fig. 6) probably restricted to the Korab Mountain Range.

FIGURE 4. Thoracal sternites, a): S. graeca; b): S. neglecta, c): S. korab sp. n.

Similar scattered distributions of microendemic species of the genus Drusus (Trichoptera) among other aquatic
organisms of Dinaric Mountains have been documented and recently discussed as allopatric speciation events due
to Pleistocene fragmentations (e.g. Previši et al. 2009, Oláh 2010, Ku ini et al. 2011).
