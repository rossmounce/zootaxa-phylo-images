Abstract
A new Alestopetersius is described from the Kwilu River in the Kasai basin of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Alestopetersius conspectus, new species, is readily distinguished from all congeners based on attributes of squamation and coloration. It is distinguished from “Duboisialestes” tumbensis by tooth morphology and in the possession of a distinctive
caudal-fin pigmentation patterning consisting of a median black band extending to the caudal-fin margin and flanked by
dense black bands in both upper and lower fin lobes. “Duboisialestes” bifasciatus, which shares similar caudal-fin pigmentation patterning, is distinguished from A. conspectus by the absence of a broad mid-lateral band on the body, and by
tooth morphology. Results from an analysis of the relationships and generic composition of the Alestidae provide support
for the monophyly for Alestopetersius inclusive of the members of the genus Duboisialestes, which are placed into synonomy with the former.
Une nouvelle espèce de Alestopetersius est décrite de la rivière Kwilu dans le bassin du Kasai de la République
Democratique du Congo. Alestopetersius conspectus, nouvelle espèce, se distingue très facilement de tout ses congénères
sur les attributs de la squamation et coloration. Cette espèce est distinguée de “Duboisialestes” tumbensis par la morphologie des dents et par la posséssion d'un type de pigmentation de la nageoire caudale composée d’une bande noire médiane
s'étendant de la marge de la caudale et flanquée de denses bandes noires dans les deux lobes supérieur et inférieur de la
nageoire. “Duboisialestes” bifasciatus qui partage le même type de pigmentation de la nageoire caudale, se distingue de
A. conspectus par l'absence d'une large bande mi-latérale sur le corps, et par la morphologie des dents. Les résultats d'une
analyse des relations et de la composition générique du Alestidae fournissent un soutien pour la monophylie des Alestopetersius incluant les membres du genre Duboisialestes, qui sont placés en synonymie avec le genre précèdent.
Key words: Alestopetersius conspectus, new species, Duboisialestes synonym of Alestopetersius

Introduction
The Kwilu River, a large left bank tributary of the Kasai River about 965 km in length and wet-season inundation
area of 1,550 km2 (Hughes, 1996), joins the Kwango River just south of the provincial capital of Bandundu.
Together these two large affluent tributaries enter the main channel of the Kasai River some 50 km upstream of the
Kasai-Fimi confluence (Fig. 1). The Kwilu, like many affluents of the Kasai, is poorly known ichthyologically
(Stiassny et al. 2011), and as part of a comparative study of northwestern Kasai tributaries, Mbimbi and Stiassny
(2011) provide a checklist of fishes collected in the Kwilu River in the vicinity of Kikwit, a river port some 250 km
upstream of Bandundu. Among the fishes reported are numerous individuals of the alestid genus, Alestopetersius
Hoedeman, 1951. As currently recognized, Alestopetersius includes seven species (Fig. 2); A. hilgendorfi (Boulenger 1899), A. brichardi Poll 1967, A. caudalis (Boulenger 1899), A. compressus (Poll & Gosse 1963), A. leopoldianus (Boulenger 1899), A. nigropterus Poll 1967 and A. smykalai Poll 1967. Recent studies (Zanata & Vari 2006;
Arroyave & Stiassny 2011) have hypothesized that members of the genus Duboisialestes Poll 1967; D. tumbensis

(Hoedman 1951) and D. bifasciatus Poll 1967, are closely related to or nested within Alestopetersius, and that
hypothesis is further investigated here. Individuals collected in the Kwilu could not be attributed to any described
Alestopetersius (or Duboisialestes) and closer examination confirms that these specimens belong to a new species
for which a description is provided below.
In addition to numerous specimens of the new species described here, was one individual seemingly of another
undescribed Alestopetersius (AMNH 252479, Alestopetersius sp. “mbuji”, Fig. 2J). We are hesitant to describe a
new taxon on the basis of a single specimen and, pending the availability of additional material, note the occurrence of this anomalous individual and provide meristic and morphometric data for the specimen (Table 1). Interestingly, despite trenchant differences in meristics and pigmentation, an exploratory phylogenetic analysis places
Alestopetersius sp. “mbuji” as the sister to Alestopetersius conspectus, new species (Fig. 3).

Material and methods
Species description. Thirteen morphometric measurements and 8 meristic counts were taken following Paugy et al.
(2003). In order to accurately count vertebral and fin-ray elements and to visualize other skeletal features, specimens
were radiographed and some were cleared and stained following a modified protocol based on Taylor and Van Dyke
(1985). CS indicates cleared and stained specimens; SL denotes standard length, and HL head length. Total vertebral counts include the four modified Weberian centra but exclude the terminal, hypural-bearing centrum. Gill
raker counts include only the rakers on the lower limb of the first arch and exclude the raker in the angle of the
arch. Institutional abbreviations follow Leviton et al. (1985).
Phylogenetic analysis. A hypothesis of relationships of Alestopetersius is presented in Figure 3. The tree is
clipped from a larger analysis (Arroyave & Stiassny in prep.) with expanded taxon sampling within “clade C” of
Arroyave & Stiassny (2011), and a total of 48 terminals (see Table 2, for additional taxa added to the matrix of
Arroyave & Stiassny 2011). Sequence data from four molecular markers; two nuclear (SH3PX3 and myh6) and
two mitochondrial (COI and cyt-b), totaling 3,266 bp, were utilized in the analysis following the methodology of
Arroyave & Stiassny (2011). Clade support was estimated with jackknife character resampling (Lanyon, 1985).

Generic assignment and synonomy of Duboisialestes. Initial placement of the new species in Alestopetersius, based on a combination of attributes of dentition and squamation following the generic concept of Poll (1967),
was confirmed by preliminary molecular analysis. We note that neither Zanata and Vari (2005) nor Arroyave and
Stiassny (2011) find support for a monophyletic Alestopetersius at the exclusion of species currently included in
the genus Duboisialestes, and the relationships depicted in Figure 3 support this conjecture. While species representation within Alestopetersius is incomplete, nodal support for the placement of Duboisialestes tumbensis and D.
bifasciatus as nested within Alestopetersius is strong (Fig. 3).

A NEW ALESTOPETERSIUS FROM DR CONGO

Zootaxa 3166 © 2012 Magnolia Press ·

63

Morphologically Duboisialestes has been distinguished from Alestopetersius on the basis of dentition, with the
former characterized by the possession of highly compressed inner row premaxillary and dentary teeth that are
closely abutting and bear numerous (8–14) small cusps. Poll (1967) also notes that the median tooth cusps in
Duboisialestes are reduced in size and only slightly larger than the flanking cusps. The highly compressed, low
cusped teeth of D. tumbensis and D. bifasciatus do appear to represent an extreme, presumably derived condition.
Nonetheless, we concur with the assessment of Géry (1977) and Schaefer (2007) that many alestid genera are
poorly defined and “over split”, and maintaining Duboisialestes would perpetuate this unsatisfactory state of taxonomic affairs. We therefore propose the synonomy of Duboisialestes with Alestopetersius, and include comparisons with A. bifasciatus and A. tumbensis in the diagnosis and discussion of the new species provided below.

Diagnosis. Alestopetersius conspectus, new species, is distinguished from A. smykalai, A. leopoldianus, A.
nigropterus, A. caudalis, and A. sp. “mbuji” in the possession of 12 (vs. 10) circumpeduncular scales. It is readily
distinguished from A. brichardi, A. compressus, A. hilgendorfi, and A. tumbensis in the possession of a caudal-fin
pigmentation consisting of a median black band extending to the caudal-fin margin and flanked by dense black
bands in both upper and lower fin lobes. Alestopetersius bifasciatus, which shares similar caudal fin pigmentation,
is distinguished from A. conspectus by the absence of a broad mid-lateral band on the body, and in tooth
morphology.

Table 1 for summary of morphometric and meristic data. Relatively gracile and shallow-bodied, body depth 26.4–
34.5 % SL (mean 32.1), greatest depth at vertical through pelvic-fin insertion. Head length 20.4–29.7 (mean 27.5),
eye large, bony orbit diameter 28.2–37.2 % HL (mean 34.9). Dorsal head profile straight from upper lip to nape,

gently convex from that point to dorsal-fin origin. Dorsal body profile gently convex along dorsal-fin base to caudal-fin base, ventral body profile gently convex between isthmus and anal-fin base, caudal peduncle slightly longer
than deep.
Mouth terminal, lower jaw prominent and slightly prognathous. Premaxilla with two teeth in outer row, each
bearing five cusps, positioned opposite interspaces between and alternating with, four inner row teeth, each bearing
6–8 cusps (Fig. 5). Outermost premaxillary tooth is markedly compressed and elongate with 7 or 8 small evenly
sized cusps and a low median cusp. Dentary with four teeth in outer row, each bearing 6 or 7 cusps, outermost tooth
smallest in jaw. No inner row teeth on dentary.

Dorsal-fin rays, ii 8 anal-fin rays iii, 18-20 (mode 19). Origin of dorsal fin slightly in advance of vertical
through pelvic-fin insertion. There is muted sexual dimorphism in fin shape; anal-fin margin convex in mature
males, and concave in females and juveniles. The first 4 or 5 branched rays of dorsal fin of mature males somewhat
elongated and filamentous.
Body covered with small, regularly imbricate scales. Lateral line complete, with 31–34 pored scales to caudal flexion, 6.5–7 scale rows between lateral line and dorsal-fin insertion, 2.5 between lateral line and pelvic-fin insertion,
12 circumpeduncular scales. Twelve to 14 elongate gill rakers arrayed along lower limb of first arch. Total vertebral
count 36 or 37 (mode 37).
Miscellaneous osteological features. Seven supraneurals are situated above the first seven rib-bearing vertebrae anterior to first dorsal-fin pterygiophore (Fig. 6A). This condition contrasts with that in most other species

examined which possess only 6 supraneurals interdigitating with neural spines of six predorsal vertebrae (Fig. 6B).
We note that Alestoptersius leopoldianus also exhibits 7 rib-bearing vertebrae anterior to dorsal fin pterygiophore,
but unlike A. conspectus has 6 rather than 7 supraneurals. Both Alestopetersius tumbensis and Alestopetersius
bifasciatus share the modal Alestopetersius configuration with 6 supraneurals interdigitating with 6 vertebrae anterior to the dorsal fin pterygiophore. The condition in the single individual of A. sp. “mbuji” is not discernable in
radiographs.

FIGURE 6. Anterior vertebrae and associated structures in (A) Alestopetersius conspectus, new species (AMNH 253476), (B)
Alestopetersius caudalis (AMNH 238424).

Coloration. In alcohol (Fig. 4A&C), base body coloration pale creamy brown with darker basal crescents at
contact zones of contiguous scales on dorsum. In males faint humeral stripe present above pectoral fin, but no trace
of humeral stripe present in preserved females (Fig. 4C). In males (Fig. 4A) a broad black band extends from
behind opercle, thickening gradually to caudal peduncle base, then narrows and extends to posterior caudal-fin
margin. Distinctive broad black band in each caudal-fin lobe flank central black band and are separated from it by
white bands. Remaining fins dusky hyaline, leading edge of pectoral fin dark brown or black. In females coloration
similar but mid-lateral band and caudal-fin bands somewhat muted (Fig. 4C). In life (Fig. 4B&D) all individuals
are iridescent silver with greenish-copper reflections anterolaterally, becoming bluish on flanks and caudal peduncle. Mid-lateral band is obscured anteriorly on body but clearly marked on caudal peduncle. Markings on caudal fin
as in preserved specimens but much of the white interspaces between black bands are bright orange.
Distribution. Currently known from the Kwilu River in the vicinity of Kikwit (Fig. 1). Collections in the main
channel of the Middle Congo River, the Kasai main channel in the region of Bandundu, and Lulua River (a neighboring tributary Kasai) did not recover any individuals of A. conspectus despite intensive sampling, suggesting that
the species may be a Kwilu endemic.
Ecology and habitat. Numerous specimens of Alestopetersius conspectus were collected at all sample sites
along a 35 km stretch of the river (Fig. 1). Most were collected using seine nets at depths of between 1–2 m. Water
temperature in the shallows where most specimens were collected was between 21–22.5oC and pH ranged from

MBIMBI & STIASSNY

5.8–6.5. The Kwilu River at the sampling sites is between 15–40 meters wide and the banks are variously covered
with dense, undisturbed riparian vegetation, heavily degraded urban areas, and cleared agricultural areas (Mbimbi
& Stiassny 2011).
Female specimens contain numerous, maturing eggs in the ovaries and males have enlarged testes suggesting
that reproductive activity was approaching at time of capture (February). Short guts (ca. 60% of SL when unraveled) and large stomachs with 6–8 fleshy pyloric caeca are suggestive of a carnivorous diet, and all specimens
examined contained large numbers of insect head capsules and disarticulated body parts, most of terrestrial origin,
with a preponderance of ants and small midges presumably taken at the water surface.
Etymology. Conspectus, from the Latin, in reference to the conspicuous markings on the caudal fin and striking, bright coloration of the species in life.

Discussion
In addition to the new species described here, collections made in the Kwilu in the vicinity of Kikwit document the
presence there of 113 species of which 29 are new records for the region, and many represent significant range
extensions within the Congo basin (Mbimbi & Stiassny 2011). The Kwilu, like the main channel of the Kasai and
its numerous affluents, is poorly known ichthyologically (Stiassny et al. 2011), and the present study underscores
the importance of continued survey and taxonomic revisional work in the basin, which is undergoing rapidly
increasing anthropogenic transformation (Brooks et al. 2011).
