Abstract
A new species of Ansonia is described from northern Tanintharyi Division, Myanmar. The new species is the first record
of Ansonia from Myanmar. It is phylogenetically most closely related to A. kraensis at the Isthmus of Kra, Thailand, but
can be distinguished from A. kraensis and all other species of Ansonia from Thailand and the Malay Peninsula by a combination of several morphological characters and dorsal and ventral color patterns.
Key words: Ansonia thinthinae, A. kraensis, stream toad, molecular phylogenetic analysis

Introduction
As part of an ongoing survey of the reptiles and amphibians of Myanmar, members of the Nature and Wildlife Conservation Division (NWCD) of the Myanmar Forest Department, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution (USNM), and California Academy of Sciences (CAS) surveyed the Tanintharyi Nature Reserve
(TNR) in March 2008 and again in September and October 2009. The TNR is an approximately 1,700 km2 reserve
ca. 70 km north of Dawei in the Tanintharyi Division of Myanmar. The TNR includes part of the Thein Ze Kalein
Aung forest (857 km2) and Lu Wine forest (843 km2). The area is predominantly semi-evergreen dipterocarpacean
rain forest (Thein 2009), and was established as a sanctuary for the Asian elephant and possibly the tiger (Lynam et
al. 2006).
Approximately 22 species of amphibians and 41 species of reptiles were found during the two surveys, including several unidentified species of frogs. Amongst these, a species of Ansonia Stoliczka was determined to be new
and is the first record of Ansonia in Myanmar.

Material and methods
Specimens were collected by hand, euthanized, tissue samples removed, and then fixed in 10% buffered formalin
before preserving in 70% ethanol. The tissue samples were stored in 95% ethanol. Latitude and longitude of specimen localities were recorded with a Garmin 12 GPS, datum WGS84. Specimens are housed in the Department of
Herpetology, CAS and the Division of Amphibians and Reptiles, USNM. Additional specimens, although not used
in this paper, are housed in the Myanmar Biodiversity Museum. The preserved specimens were examined, sexed
(using body size and presence or absence of vocal sacs, nuptial pads, and eggs), and measured. Comparisons were
made with available specimens (see material examined; museum acronyms follow Sabaj Pérez [2010]) and published descriptions of currently recognized (Frost 2011) and phylogenetically closely related (Matsui et al. 2010) or
geographically proximate species of Ansonia from Thailand and the Malay Peninsula (Inger 1960; Kiew 1985;
Matsui et al. 1998, 2005; Grismer 2006a,b; Wood et al. 2008; Quah et al. 2011).

Measurements on tadpole specimen CAS 244137 were taken following Inger (1985) and Rao et al. (2006)
using a binocular dissecting microscope with a micrometer as follows: total length, head-body length (tip of snout
to insertion of tail), head-body depth, maximum head-body width, diameter of eyeball, interorbital distance, eye to
tip of snout, internarial distance, width of oral disc, tail length, maximum tail depth, tail muscular depth, forelimb
length, hand length, thigh length, tibia length, and foot length. Staging followed Gosner (1960), oral apparatus terminology followed Altig and McDiarmid (1999), and labial tooth row formula followed Altig et al. (1998).
Genomic DNA was extracted from approximately 25mg of tissue from four adult male specimens (CAS
243857, 243873, 243947, 244216), one adult female specimen (CAS 243871), and one tadpole specimen (CAS

244136) using the Qiagen DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
DNA quality was then checked by running 5ul of the extraction out on a 1% agarose gel.
A 2685bp fragment of the mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA genes was amplified from the extracted genomic
DNA via PCR using primers ThrLm (Matsui et al. 2010) and Hedges16H1 (Hedges & Maxson 1993). Amplification reactions (25 µl) contained 50 ng DNA, 1 X PCR buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.4
µM each primer, 200 µM each dNTP, and 1.25 U of Taq. The thermal cycler profile consisted of initial denaturation
at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72ºC for 1.5 min, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were then visualized on a 1% agarose gel and purified using ExoSAP-IT
(USB, Cleveland, Ohio) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Cycle-sequencing was then carried out using the
original, external primers as well as six other internal primers: 12S-3H, 12SL1091, 12StVal-H (Matsui et al. 2010),
12SL2021, 16SH2715 (Tominaga et al. 2006), and 16S1M (Fu 2000). Cycle sequence reactions were then purified
using a standard ethanol precipitation protocol and run on an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer.
The sequences were inserted into a data matrix of already aligned sequences of species of Ansonia from Matsui et al. (2010) and inspected by eye to maximize positional homology. The six new sequences were deposited in
GenBank (JN664246–JN664251).
Uncorrected pairwise genetic distances (p-distance) were computed in PAUP* 4.0b10 (Swofford 2002) to estimate how genetically divergent these specimens are from one another and from currently known species of Ansonia. A maximum parsimony (MP) analysis using PAUP* 4.0b10 and a Bayesian analysis using MrBayes version
3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist 2001; Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) were performed on this data matrix of 36
sequences of 22 species of Ansonia, five of the six sequences of specimens from Myanmar (two sequences from
CAS 243873 and CAS 243947 were identical so only the sequence from CAS 243873 was used), and one outgroup
species, Pedostibes hosii (Boulenger) (Matsui et al. 2010). Each nucleotide was treated as an unordered character
with four alternative states, and gaps were considered missing data in all analyses.
In the MP analysis, data were treated with equal weight (Kjer 1995; Allard & Carpenter 1996; Cibois et al.
1999). We performed 100 heuristic searches with the starting trees obtained by random stepwise addition, followed
by tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping. We also performed a nonparametric bootstrap analysis
(Felsenstein 1985) with 1000 replicates, each executed as a heuristic search as above, to evaluate support for relationships, as implemented in PAUP* 4.0b10.
In the Bayesian analysis, the general-time-reversal model of base substitution (Nei & Kumar 2000) was
selected based on the results of Matsui et al. (2010). For the tree-partition analysis, the Monte Carlo Markov
Chains were simulated for 50,000,000 generations and sampled every 1000 generations. Four chains were run and
10,000 initial trees were discarded (burn-in).

Results
The Bayesian and MP analyses resulted in similar trees that were also similar to the tree presented in Matsui et al.
(2010). The Bayesian tree is presented in Figure 1. In both trees, a clade of species from Thailand and the specimens from Myanmar is strongly supported by both Bayesian (1.00 PP) and MP (86%) analyses. Within this clade,
the specimens from Myanmar form a strongly supported clade (1.00 PP, 100%) that is most closely related with
strong support (1.00 PP, 86%) to a clade of specimens representing A. kraensis Matsui, Khonsue, and Nabhitabhata. Ansonia inthanon Matsu, Nabhitabhata, and Panha, Ansonia sp. 1, and Ansonia sp. 2 were outside of this
clade with weaker support.
The p-distance between the specimens from Myanmar and A. kraensis is 5%, and between the specimens from
Myanmar and Ansonia sp. 1 is 6.5%, even though Ansonia sp. 1 is geographically the closest species to the specimens from Myanmar, possibly as close as eight km to the east in Thailand, on the opposite side of the Bilauktaung
Mountain Range, whereas, A. kraensis is over 500 km to the south at the Isthmus of Kra. These p-distances are
within the range (2.1%–13.2%) between different species of Ansonia by Matsui et al. (2010), and similar to p-distances between the species pairs A. jeetsukumarani Wood, Grismer, Ahmed, and Senawi / A. malayana Inger
(5.5%), A. torrentis Dring / A. latiffi Wood, Grismer, Ahmad, and Senawi (5.6%), A. torrentis / A. leptopus
(Günther) (5.7%), and A. muelleri (Boulenger) / A. mcgregori (Taylor) (4.5%), and greater than p-distances
between the species pairs A. torrentis / A. longidigita Inger (2.5%), and A. latiffi / A. leptopus (2.1%).

Diagnosis. Ansonia thinthinae is considered a member of the genus Ansonia based on small body size, presence of slender limbs, weak subarticular tubercles, and membranous foot webbing, but absence of parotoid glands
in adults, and presence of cup-like ventral oral disc, wide areas peripheral to tooth rows for both lips, expanded
post-dental portion of lower lip with continuous papillae along margin, upper jaw sheath divided into two separate,
keratinized parts, markedly flattened body, and eyes set relatively back on body in larvae (Inger 1960, 1992). Ansonia thinthinae can be distinguished from other congeners that are geographically (Thailand and Malay Peninsula)
or phylogenetically (clade A1 of Matsui et al. [2010]) close by a combination of the following characters: male
SVL of 22.1–29.0 mm, female SVL of 31.8 mm; head wider than long in males; light patch below eye; several yellow tubercles at corner of jaw; one vocal slit; spotting on gular region; dorsum tuberculated; first finger much
shorter than second; first and second fingers with nuptial pads in males; finger tips rounded without forming disks;
webbing reaching disks on third and fifth toes; iris yellow in life; dorsum brown with yellow interscapular spot;
venter with yellow spotting fusing into larger patterning on brown background.
Description of holotype. Snout-vent length 25.6 mm; head slightly wider than body, and slightly wider (7.6
mm) than long (7.5 mm); snout (3.2 mm) longer than eye (2.8 mm), wide (4.2 mm; SW/SVL 16%), square (SW/
HW 55%), constricted in front of eyes, dorsally concave, sloping anteroventrally between eyes and nostrils, truncate, projecting beyond lower jaw, sloping posteroventrally to mandibular symphysis when viewed laterally, with
slight midline point in dorsal profile that appears as distinct vertical ridge on anterior margin when viewed from
front; canthus rostralis distinct, slightly curved; lores straight, vertical; nostrils closer to tip of snout than eyes
(DNE 1.9 mm; DNE/SL 59%), at level of symphysis of lower jaw, directed laterally, oval, angled anterodorsally;
internarial distance (2.6 mm) narrower than interorbital distance (3.2 mm), latter wider than upper eyelid (2.2 mm);
cranial crests absent; parotids absent; margin of eyelid with row of small tubercles making it appear sharp; tympanum distinct, oval, taller (1.6 mm) than wide (1.3 mm), horizontal diameter 46% of horizontal diameter of eye, separated from eye by 38% of tympanum diameter (0.5 mm).
Longitudinal vocal slit on left side of mouth into median subgular vocal sac; vomerine ridge absent; choanae
slightly oval, interior to lingual shelf when viewed from below; tongue narrow, ending in median point; posterior

Etymology. The specific epithet is given in honor of the late Daw [Ms.] Thin Thin, who was a dedicated member of the Myanmar Herpetological Survey Team and contributed greatly to the understanding of the diversity and
natural history of amphibians and reptiles in Myanmar.

Ansonia thinthinae is phylogenetically and geographically close to A. kraensis, A. inthanon, and A. siamensis
Kiew. These three species are known from neighboring Thailand both north (A. inthanon) and south (A. kraensis,
A. siamensis) of the type locality of A. thinthinae. Ansonia thinthinae also shares two molecular synapomorphies
with these three species (bases C and T at loci 72 and 312, respectively; database available at http://dx.doi.org/
10.5061/dryad.mj0rs0dt). Ansonia thinthinae can be distinguished from A. inthanon by a larger female body size
(female SVL 23.3–25.2 in A. inthanon), two fingers with nuptial pads in males (only first finger with nuptial pad in
A. inthanon), light patch below eye (absent in A. inthanon), and venter with large yellow spotting some fusing to
elongate patterning on brown background (venter with small yellow spots on brown background in A. inthanon);
and from A. siamensis by smaller female body size (female SVL 35 mm in A. siamensis), tips of fingers not
expanded into disks (tips of fingers expanded into disks in A. siamensis), two fingers with nuptial pads in males
(first finger with nuptial pad in A. siamensis), presence of dorsal tubercles (dorsal tubercles much reduced or absent
in A. siamensis), and absence of greenish-yellow irregular markings on dorsum (present in A. siamensis).
Ansonia thinthinae is morphologically very similar to its phylogenetic sister species, A. kraensis. In addition, it
shares two unique molecular synapomorphies with A. kraensis (bases T and A at loci 1220 and 2132, respectively).
However, it can be distinguished from A. kraensis by a larger body size in both male (mean SVL 21.3 mm in A.
kraensis) and female (mean SVL 25.3 mm in A. kraensis), head wider than long in males (longer than wide in
males of A. kraensis), two fingers with nuptial pads in males (one or two fingers with nuptial pads in A. kraensis),
dorsum brown with no pattern except for interscapular spot (dorsum brown with darker Y shaped pattern beginning
at rear of eyes, merging before interscapular spot, surrounding spot, then, as inverse Y, diverging onto sides of
sacrum in A. kraensis), and venter with yellow spotting on brown background (silvery white mottling with brown
in A. kraensis). Additionally, six molecular characters are not only absent from specimens of A. kraensis but are
unique to all specimens of A. thinthinae among all species of Ansonia in the molecular phylogenetic analysis (bases
T, T, C, G, T, and T at loci 99, 130, 305, 1155, 1379, and 1380, respectively). Reciprocally, specimens of A. kraensis contain six molecular characters that are not only absent in A. thinthinae but are unique to A. kraensis among all
species of Ansonia in the molecular phylogenetic analysis (bases T, C, C, A, G, and C at loci 392, 1617, 1744, 1755,
2089, and 2366, respectively).
Distribution and natural history. Ansonia thinthinae is only known from the stream of the type locality and
approximately 4.7 km to the west along Me Kyauklonegyi Stream (Figure 6), but is expected in other streams that
flow westward from the Bilauktaung Mountain Range. Adult specimens were collected between 10:00 and 14:00 h
under stones along the edge of a second-order stream approximately 3 m wide at an altitude of 400–450 m and at
24:00 h among stones at the edge of the approximately 10 m wide and 0.6 m deep Me Kyauklonegyi Stream at an
altitude of 158 m. The tadpoles were collected from the upper surface of a boulder midstream of the Me Kyauklonegyi Stream where they were attached by their oral discs. The boulder was submerged under a sheet of approximately 3 mm of flowing water.

Discussion
Ansonia thinthinae, with a male body size of 22–29 mm and a female body size of 31 mm, seems to follow a trend
of phylogenetically related, small-sized species of Ansonia from the Malay Peninsula and Thailand (most species
of clade A1 of Matsui et al. [2010]). What is surprising is the phylogenetically closer relationship of A. thinthinae
with A. kraensis than with Ansonia sp. 1 of Matsui et al. (2010), even though Ansonia sp. 1 was found just on the
eastern side of the Bilauktaung Mountain Range that separates Thailand from Myanmar. This result indicates that
the mountain range may be a barrier to dispersal even though it is only approximately 770 to 1000 m high nearest
the type locality, and that A. thinthinae may be closely tied to the Dawei (Tavoy) River watershed west of this
mountain range. This also conforms to the observations of limited ranges in other species of this genus on the
Malay Peninsula (Wood et al. 2008; Matsui et al. 2010). Additional surveys to both the north and south of the
localities on both the western and eastern sides of the Bilauktaung mountains will help to better delimit the range of
A. thinthinae and determine if the range extends into other watersheds, such as the Tenasserim River watershed to
the south, and if it intersects with neighboring species, such as A. kraensis, A. inthanon, and Ansonia sp. 1, or if
there are intervening populations that may be species yet unknown to science.
