Kuroda (1960) noted that his new species, Vertigo shimochii Kuroda & Amano, 1960, was distinct from other members
of the genus in Japan by possessing a “relatively large and long shell with deep suture and much inflated whorls” (p. 77).
While shell shape was noted to be similar to a Gastrocopta, they assigned the species to Vertigo based on its “shell color
and lamella characteristics” (p. 77). Vertigo shimochii has since been considered endemic to the southern parts of Japan
(The Environment Agency 1988; Minato 1988; Azuma 1995; Biodiversity Center of Japan 2002), and of near threatened
status in the Kagoshima Prefecture Red Data Book (Kagoshima Prefectural Government 2003).
However, careful examination of V. shimochii shell features suggests that this taxon may have been misclassified.
The most striking evidence of this is the presence of a bifid parietal lamella, which is never present in Vertigo (Figure 1;
Nekola & Coles 2010). Additionally, brown shells are not limited to Vertigo; species in Gastrocopta subgenus
Gastrocopta also possess this trait. In fact, V. shimochii shells appear essentially identical to Caribbean material of
Gastrocopta servilis (Gould, 1843), a well–known waif that has been commonly transported with horticultural plants
across many Pacific archipelagos (Cowie 1998).
To resolve the taxonomic status of V. shimochii, we compared DNA sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome
oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) and 16S ribosomal RNA (16S) and internal transcribed spacer–2 (ITS–2) of the nuclear
ribosomal RNA gene complex from topotype material collected on Okinawa to other Gastrocopta and Vertigo species
from across the northern hemisphere.

Methods
Twenty–one specimens, representing two V. shimochii, fourteen Gastrocopta and five Vertigo were chosen for analysis.
Vertigo japonica and G. armigerella represent comparative material from the Japanese fauna. The remainder were
sourced either from North America or Europe (Table 1). All specimens were either live, live–collected and preserved in
ethanol, or mummified. Genomic DNA was extracted using the OmegaBioTek Mollusk DNA Extraction Kit. PCR
amplification and sequencing of CO1, 16S, and ITS–2 was accomplished using standard methods (Nekola et al. 2009). In
addition, previously analyzed sequence data (CO1, 16S, ITS–2) from an extra twelve Gastrocopta, Pupilla, Vallonia and
Vertigo specimens were retrieved from GeneBank (Table 1).
Primer ends were removed and all amplicons were aligned by eye. Mega 5.0 was used to construct both nearest–
neighbor joining (NNJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses for each gene. NNJ was based on Maximum Composite
Distance (MCL) including transitions and transversions with pairwise gap deletion. ML used all sites and was based on
the Tamura–Nei substitution model, a five–category Gamma Distribution for substitution rates, and the Nearest Neighbor
Interchange ML heuristic method. In both cases support values were estimated from 1000 bootstrap replicates.

Results
All 32 CO1 sequences were 655 bp long. The 31 16S sequences ranged from 447–456 bp in Gastrocopta, 443–446 in
Vertigo, 450–453 in Pupilla, and was 443 for Vallonia. The ITS–2 sequences ranged from 825–865 bp in Gastrocopta,
618–763 in Vertigo, and was 907 for Pupilla.

VERTIGO SHIMOCHII = GASTROCOPTA SERVILIS

FIGURE 2. Phylogram showing the distribution of analyzed Gastrocopta, Vertigo, Vallonia and Pupilla species based
on A. CO1; B. 16S; and C. ITS-2. Nodes with support values of approximately 70 or more across both NNJ and ML have
been labeled by two numbers to the left of each node. The upper (normal font) represents the NNJ support values while
the lower (bold italic font) represents ML values. Bottom scale bar is presented in Maximum Composite Distance.
All NNJ and ML results for a given gene generated outputs with identical topologies for all highly supported nodes.
As a result, only a single diagram is presented for each gene. The CO1 (Figure 2A) and 16S (Figure 3B) diagrams both
demonstrate that ‘V. shimochii’ is very similar to G. servilis. In CO1 these two taxa possessed an MCL distance of only
0.009; in 16S this distance was only 0.004. In CO1, the ‘V. shimochii’/G. servilis group was found to have a MCL
distance of approximately 0.06 from its closest neighbor – G. pellucida – and 0.15 from V. japonica. In 16S the ‘V.
shimochii’/G. servilis group was found to have a MCL distance of approximately 0.05 from its closest neighbor – G.
pellucida – and 3.8 from V. japonica.
Because the 16S region evolves more slowly than CO1 it should also provide better resolution for older evolutionary
relationships. ‘Vertigo shimochii’ not only resides within the highly supported group containing the genus Gastrocopta,
but also within a highly supported subgroup that includes ‘V. shimochii’ / G. servilis and G. pellucida (Pfeiffer, 1841), G.
dalliana (Sterki, 1898), G. rogersensis Nekola & Coles, 2001, G, procera (Gould, 1840), and G. cristata (Pilsbry &
Vanatta, 1900). This group in essence corresponds with tropical and warm–temperate Gastrocopta (Gastrocopta).
However, G. dalliana has previously been placed into subgenus Immersidens on the basis of angulo–parietal lamella
architecture (Pilsbry 1948). Yet, it differs from most other subgenus Immersidens members by its cylindrical shell, a
characteristic it shares with other subgenus Gastrocopta members. It should be noted that like G. rogersensis, G. dalliana
has a channeled angulo–parietal lamella (Nekola & Coles 2001), implying that this character may not be useful in
demarcating Gastrocopta subgenera.
The ITS–2 sequence for ‘V. shimochii’ could be aligned neither with Vertigo nor Pupilla, although it could be aligned
with Gastrocopta. The ITS–2 Gastrocopta diagram (Figure 2C) demonstrates that ‘V. shimochii’ and G. pellucida are
both members of the same highly supported group. The MCL distance between these two taxa is 0.014.

Discussion.
These analyses demonstrate that ‘V. shimochii’ represents a junior synonym of G. servilis, with both taxa possessing
similar shells and an MCL distance of <0.01 in their DNA sequences. Both of these taxa also reside in a highly supported
group that contains other members of Gastrocopta (Gastrocopta).
Gastrocopta servilis is a well–known exotic throughout the Pacific. In hindsight it is therefore not surprising that
fossil or subfossil records for ‘V. shimochii’ do not exist. While no populations were known until its initial discovery, 50
years later this species represents one of the most abundant microsnails on the Okinawa coast, with its range having
expanded north into the Amami, Ogawawara, and Yaeyama Islands (Biodiversity Center of Japan 2002). Rather than
representing a rare southern Japan endemic species of potential conservation importance, these populations simply
represent a recent and continuing range expansion of a Caribbean exotic.
